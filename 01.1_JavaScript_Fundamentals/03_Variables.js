// Variables:
//Declaring a  Variable:
/* Variable Syntax: */ var VarName = "Value";

/* Variables should NEVER begin with:
"0-9" or a symbol. and must ONLY ever begin with:
"A-Z", "a-z", "_" or  "$". */

var myName = "Michael";
// This is NOT the same as:
var myname = "Michael";
// Variables are Case-Sensitive.

//There are also RESERVED names  as well,  like:
alert;
// As pre-existing functions CANNOT be over-written.
var myNumber = 23; // Numbers don't necessarily need quotes.
// Examples of these include: INT (A whole Number), Float (A Decimal Number) etc.
var myNumber = "23"; // Numbers INSIDE of quotes have a STRING value.

// There are TWO types of Variables. 01: Local Variables:
//These EXIST INSIDE of a FUNCTION and then canNOT be ACCESSED as soon as the function STOPS running.

// 02: Global Variables:
// These are DECLARED OUTSIDE of functions, and can  be ACCESSED  INSIDE or OUTSIDE as they REMAIN after a function STOPS running.
